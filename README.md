# Run Opentrons Thermocycler Stand-alone
This is a small python script to operate the [Thermocycler Module](https://www.opentrons.com/modules/#thermocycler)  WITHOUT OT-2 Robot.

## Background
I wanted to install a PCR device to the [LabDroid Maholo](https://rbi.co.jp/en/) to implement varieties of protocols that require PCR process.
There are few options of PCR devices which support robot arm interactions.
The Opentrons Thermocycler Module is available at very affordable price (Kudos to Opentrons!).
I ordered this module, connected to a Raspberry Pi, and wrote a python script to validate this module for serious biological protocols.
